cd to the location where you want to create the folder

1. mkdir "name of folder" and cd into that folder
   ex. mkdir basic_repo
2. git init once inside folder
3. Create files (ex. touch index.html style.css script.js)
4. git add . (The . adds all the files at once)
5. git commit -m "message is typed here"
6. git remote add origin https://github.com/davenaugler/....
8. git push -u origin master
9. code folder "name of folder" (to open fodler in VS Code)
10. Add, change, etc. to code then go back into terminal and type...
11. git commit -m "type message here"
12. git push
